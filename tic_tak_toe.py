"""
A little project in base python.
A tic-tak-toe game. Written using functions and cycles.
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os,
is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns
marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks
in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
