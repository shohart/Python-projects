[Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/shohart/UDEMY-python-projects/tree/master/project_1_tic_tak_toe_game)

This project is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The user is prompted to select either X or O. The computer will then randomly generate a selection and the game will begin. The winner will be determined when either the user or the computer has 3 pieces in a row.

[Project 2: War card game](https://github.com/shohart/UDEMY-python-projects/tree/master/project_2_card_war_game)

The game is played between two players and requires a standard 52-card deck. The cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 26 cards. The players then take turns playing the top card from their hand. The player whose card has the higher value wins the battle and collects both cards. If both cards have the same value, it is a war. In a war, both players place additional cards face-down and then reveal the top card from each of those cards. The player who reveals a card with the higher value wins all the cards from the war. If both cards have the same value, the war continues until one player runs out of cards or both players agree to end the game. The player with all the cards at the end of the game wins.

[Project 3: Guess the Number](https://github.com/shohart/UDEMY-python-projects/tree/master/project_3_guess_the_number)

This game is used to find a random number in a minimum number of tries possible. To play, the computer generates a random integer between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what number it is.
